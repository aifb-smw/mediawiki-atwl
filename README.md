# AskQ!
An extension for Semantic MediaWiki that aims to make it easier for users to perform semantic queries without having to know the Ask query syntax. In addition, it modifies Special:Ask to provide a facet browser on top of the normal results display. A list of the most-used properties for pages in the result set is shown, with the ability to select and de-select properties and have the result reload dynamically.
